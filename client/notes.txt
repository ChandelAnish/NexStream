🎥 Types of Streaming

                1️⃣ On-Demand Streaming (VOD – Video on Demand)

                        -> Content is pre-recorded.
                        -> Stored on servers and delivered in chunks (HLS, DASH).
                        -> User can pause, rewind, skip ahead.
                        👉 Examples: YouTube videos, Netflix, Disney+, Spotify songs.

                2️⃣ Live Streaming

                        -> Content is captured and transmitted in real time.
                        -> Viewers watch as it happens, with small delay (latency).
                        -> Uses RTMP → HLS/DASH/WebRTC to reach viewers.
                        👉 Examples: Twitch, YouTube Live, football match broadcast, live webinars.

                3️⃣ Audio Streaming

                        -> Focused only on audio data (music, podcasts, radio).
                        -> Works similarly to video streaming but lighter.
                        👉 Examples: Spotify, Apple Music, online radio.

                4️⃣ Game/Screen Streaming

                        -> Captures your screen/gameplay and streams it live to others.
                        -> Requires low latency so viewers don’t see big delays.
                        👉 Examples: Twitch gaming streams, Discord screen share, Google Stadia (cloud gaming).

                5️⃣ Real-Time Communication (RTC)

                        -> Interactive streaming where people send/receive audio + video both ways.
                        -> Requires ultra-low latency (<1s).
                        -> Usually built on WebRTC.
                        👉 Examples: Zoom, Google Meet, video calls, online classes.

                6️⃣ Progressive Download (not true streaming, but often confused)

                        -> Video/audio file is downloaded from start → end.
                        -> Can start playing before fully downloaded.
                        -> No adaptive bitrate, less efficient than HLS/DASH.
                        👉 Example: Watching an MP4 directly from a web link.

🎬 Full Flow of VOD System


        1️⃣ Upload Stage (Content Creation)

        User/Streamer uploads a video file (.mp4, .mov, etc.) to your system.
        This is just the raw file — not yet optimized for streaming.
        👉 Example: You upload mygame.mp4.

        2️⃣ Processing Stage (Transcoding & Packaging)

        FFmpeg (or another encoder) takes the raw file and:
                1) Transcodes it into standard codecs:
                        -> Video → H.264 (for wide compatibility)
                        -> Audio → AAC

                2) Creates multiple bitrates/resolutions:

                        -> 1080p (high quality)
                        -> 720p (medium)
                        -> 480p (low, for slow internet)

                3) splits video into chunks (small .ts files, e.g., 4–10 seconds each).

                4) Generates playlist(s) (.m3u8 for HLS or .mpd for DASH).

        👉 Output looks like this:

        master.m3u8     ← points to all qualities
        1080p.m3u8      ← lists 1080p chunks
        720p.m3u8
        480p.m3u8
        segment0.ts
        segment1.ts
        segment2.ts
        ...

        3️⃣ Storage & Distribution

                - All these files (chunks + playlists) are saved on:
                        -> Your server, or
                        -> A CDN (Content Delivery Network) like AWS CloudFront, Cloudflare, Akamai.
                - Since it’s just HTTP files, it can be delivered at scale easily.

        4️⃣ Playback (Viewer Side)

        - The user opens your app/website.
        - The video player (like hls.js in a React/Next.js frontend) loads the master.m3u8.
        - The player:
                -> Reads which qualities (1080p, 720p, etc.) are available.
                -> Picks one based on internet speed.
                -> Starts downloading small .ts chunks in order.
                -> If bandwidth drops, it auto-switches to lower quality (adaptive bitrate).

        👉 To the viewer, it looks like a smooth YouTube-style experience.

        5️⃣ User Experience

                -> Can pause, rewind, seek (because the whole file exists).
                -> Smooth playback because only small chunks are streamed at a time.
                -> Adaptive streaming ensures minimal buffering.

        ✅ Summary Flow (Step by Step)

        [Uploader]
        ↓ (raw video)
        [Server: FFmpeg]
        - Transcode → H.264 + AAC
        - Multi-quality → 1080p/720p/480p
        - Chunking → segment0.ts, segment1.ts…
        - Playlist → .m3u8 (HLS)
        ↓
        [Storage/CDN]
        - Stores chunks + playlists
        ↓
        [Viewer Player (hls.js)]
        - Loads master.m3u8
        - Fetches .ts chunks over HTTP
        - Plays video, adapts quality


        👉 In one sentence:
        VOD = Upload video → Server processes into streaming format → Store as chunks + playlist → Player downloads & plays smoothly.

Video Formats
        🎬 What is an MP4 file?

        MP4 = “MPEG-4 Part 14”
        It’s a container format → like a box that holds different types of media.
        Inside an MP4, you can have:

                -> Video (usually H.264, H.265, VP9…)
                -> Audio (usually AAC, MP3…)
                -> Subtitles (captions)
                -> Metadata (title, duration, thumbnail, etc.)

        👉 Think of MP4 as a folder in one file that packs video + audio + extras together neatly.

        🎞 What is a MOV file?

                -> MOV = Apple QuickTime Movie format.
                -> Also a container format, just like MP4.
                -> Developed by Apple → works best in Mac/iOS/QuickTime ecosystem.
                -> Stores the same kinds of things: video, audio, subtitles, metadata.

        🔑 Difference Between MP4 and MOV

                Feature 	        MP4	                                        MOV

                Origin  	        Standard (MPEG group)	                        Apple (QuickTime)
                Compatibility           Works everywhere (web, PC, mobile, TV)	        Best on Apple devices/software
                File size	        Usually smaller (more compressed)	        Larger (less compressed, higher quality)
                Usage   	        Streaming, sharing, web videos	                Professional video editing (Final Cut, iMovie)

        👉 Example:

        If you upload to YouTube/Netflix → use MP4 (universal).
        If you’re editing in Final Cut Pro on Mac → MOV is common.





        When FFmpeg finishes encoding the raw video + audio into compressed streams (like H.264 video + AAC audio), those streams still need a “box” to live in. That box is called a container format.

        A container is like a folder/box that holds:

                - the video stream,
                - the audio stream,
                - subtitles (optional),
                - metadata (title, duration, codec info, etc.).

        Common Containers:

                - .mp4 → Most popular, widely supported (H.264/H.265 + AAC audio).
                - .mkv → More flexible, can hold almost any codec (used for movies, supports multiple audio/subtitle tracks).
                - .ts (MPEG Transport Stream) → Often used in broadcasting, streaming (e.g., live TV, HLS).

        👉 Example:
                If you have H.264 video + AAC audio, you could wrap them into:

                        - movie.mp4 (standard for web/mobile)
                        - movie.mkv (for flexibility, e.g., multiple subtitles/audio)
                        - movie.ts (for live streaming chunks).

        So the line you asked about means: ➡️ After FFmpeg encodes, it wraps the streams inside one of these containers to produce the final playable file.





        1. MP4 & MOV

                - These are file-based containers.
                - They hold the entire compressed video + audio from start to end in one file.
                - Example: movie.mp4 → contains the full 2-hour movie.

        2. .TS (MPEG Transport Stream)

                - Designed for broadcasting and streaming.
                - Instead of one big file, it can be broken into small chunks (e.g., 2–10 seconds each).
                - That’s why .ts is often used in HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) → video is split into many .ts parts, and a playlist file (.m3u8) tells the player which chunk to play next.

                👉 But .ts can also store a whole video in one file (like .mp4), it’s just more common to see it split into chunks for streaming.

        each .ts (Transport Stream) file can contain:

                - 🎥 Video (usually H.264, H.265, etc.)
                - 🔊 Audio (AAC, MP3, etc.)
                - 📝 Subtitles/Closed Captions (if included)
                - ℹ️ Metadata (timestamps, program info, error correction, etc.)

        But here’s the key point: 👉 Each .ts chunk is self-contained. That means even if you take one .ts file (say, a 5-second chunk), it has everything needed (video + audio + metadata) to play that 5 seconds properly.

        That’s why streaming works:

                - Your video player downloads .ts chunks one by one.
                - Each chunk has its own mini package of audio + video + metadata.
                - The player stitches them together smoothly using the playlist (.m3u8).

                So, every .ts chunk is like a little standalone media container for a short duration.

        So:

                - MP4 / MOV = whole video in one piece (good for download/playback).
                - TS = usually smaller pieces (good for live/streaming), but can also be one big file.

Bitrate And Bandwidth
        🎚 What is Bitrate?

                -> Bitrate = the amount of data per second needed to play a video or audio.
                -> Measured in kbps (kilobits per second) or Mbps (megabits per second).

                👉 Example: A video encoded at 5 Mbps means every second of video requires 5 megabits of data.

        Why it matters:

                Higher bitrate → better quality (more detail, less compression).
                Lower bitrate → smaller size, loads faster, but may look blurry or pixelated.

        📡 What is Bandwidth?

                -> Bandwidth = the maximum amount of data your internet connection can transfer per second.
                -> Also measured in Mbps.
                -> Think of it like the width of a water pipe:
                        - Bigger pipe (more bandwidth) → more water (data) flows at once.
                        - Smaller pipe → less water flows, might choke if too much is sent.

        🔄 How Bitrate Consumes Bandwidth

                To watch a video, your internet must handle at least the bitrate of the stream.

                👉 Example:
                        - If a video is encoded at 5 Mbps and your internet bandwidth is 10 Mbps, playback is smooth.
                        - If your internet bandwidth is only 2 Mbps, you’ll see buffering (can’t keep up).

                So:
                        - Bitrate is demand (how much data the video needs).
                        - Bandwidth is supply (how much your network can deliver).

        ⚡ Real-world Example (YouTube/Netflix)

                - 1080p HD → ~5 Mbps bitrate
                - 4K Ultra HD → ~15–25 Mbps bitrate
                - Audio only → ~128 kbps bitrate

                - If your Wi-Fi bandwidth is 20 Mbps: You can easily watch 4K video.
                - If your Wi-Fi bandwidth is 3 Mbps: You’ll have to drop to 480p or 360p to avoid buffering.

        ✅ In short:

        Bitrate = video’s hunger for data per second.
        Bandwidth = how much food (data) your internet pipe can deliver per second.
        The video will only play smoothly if bandwidth ≥ bitrate.
-----------





-----------
📦 What is Object Storage?

        -> Object storage is a way of storing data (like videos, images, documents) in the cloud as objects, not as files in folders or rows in a database.

        Each object has:

                - Data (the actual video, image, etc.)
                - Metadata (info about the file — size, type, created date, etc.)
                - Unique ID (key) to find it

                👉 Example: Instead of saying “video.mp4 is in folder X”, you say “give me object with ID 12345”.

        🔹 How It Works

                - You upload your file → object storage saves it as an object.
                - You don’t care where it’s physically stored — the cloud provider handles it.
                - You access it via a URL or API.

        ✅ Why It’s Useful

                - Scalable: Can store billions of objects (good for YouTube-like apps).
                - Cheap: You only pay for the space used.
                - Durable: Data is stored in multiple locations, so it rarely gets lost.
                - Easy access: Files can be fetched over HTTP.

        🌍 Examples of Object Storage

                - Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
                - Google Cloud Storage
                - Azure Blob Storage
                - MinIO (open-source, S3-compatible)

        🆚 File System vs Database vs Object Storage

                - File system → good for local small-scale use (folders, files).
                - Database → good for structured data (users, transactions).
                - Object storage → good for unstructured, huge data (videos, images, backups).

        🎯 In Your VOD System

                - When users upload videos → store the original file in object storage (like S3).
                - After FFmpeg processes them into chunks + playlists → also save them in object storage.
                - Then connect a CDN (CloudFront, Cloudflare) to deliver them worldwide.

        👉 In one line:
        Object storage = cloud “bucket” where you drop your files (as objects) and fetch them later via URL.

🎥 Video Codecs

        -> A codec = COmpressor + DECompressor → it compresses video so it’s smaller to store/send, then decompresses it for playback.

        🎬 Why do we use Codecs?

                - Raw video and audio are huge. A single minute of uncompressed 1080p video can be several GBs.
                👉 That’s impossible to store, upload, or stream efficiently.

                - So, codecs compress the data while keeping quality good enough.

        In your system (VOD or Live):

                - Streamer (or uploader): The video is encoded (compressed) before sending — OBS, WebRTC, or phone camera usually does this.
                - Server (processing with FFmpeg): If needed, re-encode into different bitrates/qualities (1080p, 720p, 480p).
                - Viewer (player/browser): The codec decompresses the stream so it can play smoothly.

                👉 So codecs are used at all three stages: encode → transmit/store → decode.

        🎥 Where Video is Converted into H.264 (or other codecs)

                1️⃣ At the Source (Client Side)

                        - Most of the time, video is already compressed before leaving your device.
                        - Your webcam, screen capture, or OBS software will encode the raw video into H.264 (video) + AAC (audio) before sending.
                        - Reason: Raw video is HUGE (gigabytes per minute). You can’t send that over the internet.

                👉 Example:

                        - OBS encodes your gameplay in H.264 + AAC and then pushes it to the server using RTMP.
                        - WebRTC in the browser uses built-in codecs (VP8/VP9 or H.264) before sending.


                2️⃣ On the Server (Transcoding Stage)

                        Even if the client already sends H.264, the server often re-encodes:

                                - To generate multiple resolutions/bitrates (1080p, 720p, 480p).
                                - To ensure compatibility across devices (phones, TVs, browsers).
                                - To apply compression settings (reduce bandwidth).

                        👉 This step is usually handled by FFmpeg or a media server (e.g., Wowza, Ant Media, Janus, LiveKit).

                But in case of VOD:
                        Client Side: 
                                - When you upload to YouTube, your browser/app just sends the video file as it is over HTTP/HTTPS to YouTube’s servers.
                                - There is no special compression done before upload (other than whatever codec/format your file already has — e.g., your screen recorder may have already encoded it as MP4/H.264). So if your video file is 1 GB on disk, that 1 GB is uploaded.


                        Once the file is uploaded, YouTube’s backend takes over:

                                - Decode → Read your uploaded file (whatever codec/container it uses: MP4, MOV, etc.).
                                - Re-encode (transcode) into standard formats:
                                        - Video → H.264/VP9/AV1 (multiple qualities: 1080p, 720p, 480p, etc.)
                                        - Audio → AAC/Opus
                                - Package into streaming formats (HLS/DASH).
                                - Store the processed chunks/playlists on their servers/CDNs.
                                - Make it available to viewers with adaptive bitrate streaming.


        Different Codecs (video compression standard):

                1. H.264 (AVC – Advanced Video Coding)

                        - The most common video codec today.
                        - Used by YouTube, Netflix, Zoom, and almost every device.
                        - Balance: Good quality + reasonable file size.
                        - Supported everywhere (browsers, phones, TVs).

                        👉 Think of it as the default video format for the internet.

                2. H.265 (HEVC – High Efficiency Video Coding)

                        - Successor to H.264.
                        - Same quality at ~50% smaller size.
                        - Great for 4K/8K videos (saves bandwidth).
                        - But: More CPU/GPU power needed and not all devices support it (licensing issues).

                        👉 Used in 4K streaming, Blu-ray, and some Apple devices.

                3. VP9

                        - Made by Google as an open-source alternative to H.265.
                        - Also gives smaller file sizes than H.264.
                        - Widely used in YouTube 4K/HD streaming.
                        - Supported in Chrome, Firefox, Android, but not all hardware.

                        👉 Google’s “free” competitor to H.265.
                
                4. AV1
                        - AV1 (newest, by Alliance for Open Media: Google, Netflix, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.) → free and even more efficient than H.265.
                        - Downside: needs more CPU/GPU power to encode.

                🎵 Audio Codec

                        - Audio codecs compress sound like video codecs compress video.

                4. AAC (Advanced Audio Coding)

                        - Standard audio codec for streaming.
                        - Successor to MP3 (better quality at same bitrate).
                        - Used in YouTube, Spotify, iTunes, and all video streaming.
                        - Works well with H.264/H.265/VP9.

                        👉 Think of it as the MP3 of video platforms.

                ✅ Simple Analogy

                        - H.264 / H.265 / VP9 = different ways of packing your video clothes into a suitcase → smaller suitcase = cheaper to ship.
                        - AAC = the way you pack your audio clothes into a smaller bag.

                Together, they make videos streamable without eating too much bandwidth.

                ⚡ Example:

                        - A 10-minute uncompressed 1080p video = hundreds of GBs ❌
                        - Same video with H.264 + AAC = maybe 100 MB ✅

Raw Video and Audio

        🎞 What are Raw Video Frames?

                - A video is just a sequence of images shown very fast (like 30 or 60 per second).
                - Each of those images is called a frame.
                - A raw video frame = the full uncompressed image data for that moment in time.

                👉 Example:

                        - A single 1920×1080 (1080p) raw frame ≈ 6 MB (RGB).
                        - 30 frames per second → 180 MB per second of raw video 😲
                        - That’s why raw video is huge and needs compression (H.264, VP9, etc.).

        🎵 What is Raw Audio?

                - Audio is a continuous waveform of sound.
                - A raw audio sample = the uncompressed digital values representing the waveform (often called PCM – Pulse Code Modulation).

                👉 Example:

                                - CD-quality raw audio (44.1 kHz, 16-bit, stereo) = 1.4 Mbps.
                                - Compressed as AAC/MP3 → ~128 kbps (much smaller).

                🔹 Why Do We Decode to Raw?

                        - Because codecs (H.264, AAC, etc.) are like secret codes (compressed formats).
                        - If you want to edit, resize, re-encode, or transcode the video/audio → you must first decode it into its raw form (frames + samples).
                        - Once raw, FFmpeg can:

                                - Apply filters (resize, crop, add watermark).
                                - Change codecs (e.g., VP9 → H.264).
                                - Create different bitrates/resolutions.

                👉 Analogy:

                        - A compressed video (H.264) is like a zipped file.
                        - To change or repack it, you must unzip (decode) to the original contents → make edits → then zip (encode) again.

🎬 FFmpeg Decoding

        🎬 Why Do We Need to Decode in FFmpeg?

                1️⃣ Different Input Formats

                        - Users upload all kinds of files: MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI…
                        - Inside, these can have different codecs: H.264, VP9, HEVC, ProRes, etc.
                        - To standardize them, FFmpeg must understand (decode) whatever codec is used → into raw frames/audio.

                        👉 Example: Your phone records in HEVC, another camera records in ProRes → FFmpeg can’t mix/convert them unless it first decodes them to raw.

                2️⃣ Apply Processing or Filters

                        - You can’t resize, crop, watermark, or adjust brightness on compressed video directly.
                        - Those operations need raw frames (like editing photos).
                        - So FFmpeg decodes to raw → applies changes → then re-encodes.

                        - 👉 Example: If you want 1080p and 720p versions: Decode original → resize raw frames → re-encode at new resolutions.

                3️⃣ Change Codec or Bitrate (Transcoding)

                        - If the input codec ≠ output codec, you must decode first.
                        - Example:

                                - Input: VP9
                                - Output: H.264 (for better compatibility)
                                - Step: Decode VP9 → raw → encode H.264

                                👉 Same goes for changing bitrate (say 8 Mbps → 2 Mbps).

                4️⃣ Guarantee Compatibility

                        - Even if you upload H.264, it might have weird settings (wrong profile, unusual GOP size, bad keyframes).
                        - Platforms (YouTube, Netflix, etc.) re-decode and re-encode everything to enforce their standard pipeline.
                        - 👉 That’s why YouTube always says “Processing…” after upload.

                ✅ In Short

                        We need to decode because:

                                - Uploaded videos come in many codecs and formats.
                                - To edit, filter, or resize, we must work with raw frames.
                                - To transcode into new codecs/bitrates, we need to uncompress first.
                                - To ensure consistency and compatibility across all devices.

                💡 Analogy:

                        - A compressed video is like a zipped folder.
                        - If you want to reorganize files inside, you must unzip (decode) → make changes → zip (encode) again






                🔹 Uploaded video ≠ raw

                        - When you upload a video (MP4, MOV, MKV, etc.), it is already compressed by some codec (H.264, H.265, VP9, etc.).
                        - That’s why the file size is manageable (e.g., 500 MB instead of 50 GB).
                        - Your camera, screen recorder, or editing software already encoded it before saving.

                🔹 What “Decode the input” really means

                        - The uploaded video is in a compressed format (H.264, AAC, etc.).
                        - FFmpeg must decode (unpack) those compressed streams into raw frames + raw audio samples inside memory.
                        - Once raw, FFmpeg can process, filter, resize, or re-encode.

                        👉 The uploaded file itself is not uncompressed, but FFmpeg temporarily uncompresses it in memory to work on it.

                🔹 Why not just copy without decoding?

                        Sometimes we can!

                        - If the uploaded video is already in H.264 + AAC (the exact format we want), FFmpeg can skip decoding and just re-package (called remuxing).
                        - Example: ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c copy output.mkv
                                - Here FFmpeg doesn’t decode/encode, it just puts the compressed streams into a new container.

                        - But in most streaming platforms (like YouTube):

                                - They re-encode everything to guarantee compatibility, multiple resolutions, and consistent settings.
                                - So decoding → raw → re-encode is necessary.

                        ✅ In Short:

                                - Uploaded video = already compressed (H.264, VP9, etc.).
                                - FFmpeg decode step = temporarily uncompresses it into raw frames/audio in memory.
                                - Then re-encodes into the platform’s preferred codec/resolutions.





                🎬 Example: User Uploads an MP4 Video

                        📤 Step 1: Upload

                                - User uploads video.mp4 to your server.
                                - Inside that MP4:
                                        - Video track → H.264 (compressed frames)
                                        - Audio track → AAC (compressed audio samples)

                                - The file is already compressed (not raw).

                        ⚙️ Step 2: FFmpeg Reads & Decodes

                                - FFmpeg opens the MP4 file and decodes:
                                        - H.264 video → expanded into raw video frames (bitmaps of each frame).
                                        - AAC audio → expanded into raw PCM samples (waveform data).

                                👉 Example command: ffmpeg -i video.mp4 output.raw
                                        - This would literally dump raw frames/audio (huge files). Normally, you don’t save raw — you just hold it in memory.
                                        - Raw video format inside FFmpeg → often YUV420p (pixel data).
                                        - Raw audio format inside FFmpeg → often PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) samples.

                        🔄 Step 3: Processing (Optional)

                                While FFmpeg has the raw frames in memory, it can:
                                        - Resize (1080p → 720p, 480p).
                                        - Apply filters (watermark, brightness, crop).
                                        - Change frame rate (60 fps → 30 fps).

                        👉 Example: ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vf scale=1280:720 output.mp4
                                - Decodes → resizes raw frames → re-encodes.

                        📦 Step 4: Re-Encode

                                - After processing, FFmpeg re-encodes the raw frames/audio into your target format.
                                - For streaming systems:
                                        - Video → H.264 (universal)
                                        - Audio → AAC (universal)

                        👉 Example:

                                ffmpeg -i video.mp4 \
                                -c:v libx264 -b:v 3000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.m3u8
                                
                                - This decodes input → re-encodes into H.264/AAC → packages as HLS.

                        ✅ Final Output

                        Now you have streaming-friendly files: Video chunks (segment0.ts, segment1.ts …) and Playlist (.m3u8) All encoded in H.264 (video) + AAC (audio).

what is meant by 720p, 1080p, ...

        When you hear 720p, 1080p, 4K, etc., it’s talking about video resolution — basically how many pixels (tiny dots) make up the picture.

                720p (HD):
                        - The “720” means 720 pixels tall (height).
                        - Standard width is 1280 pixels.
                        - So resolution = 1280 × 720 pixels.

                1080p (Full HD):
                        - Height = 1080 pixels.
                        - Width = 1920 pixels.
                        - So resolution = 1920 × 1080 pixels.

                👉 Bigger numbers = more pixels = sharper video (if your screen and internet can handle it).



        The “p” in 720p or 1080p stands for progressive scan.

                        - In progressive scan, every frame of the video is drawn line by line from top to bottom in one go.
                        - This is different from “i” (interlaced scan), like 1080i, where the picture is drawn in two passes: first the odd lines, then the even lines.

                So:

                        - 720p → video has 720 horizontal lines, shown progressively (all at once per frame).
                        - 1080p → video has 1080 horizontal lines, also shown progressively.

                👉 The “p” basically means the image looks smoother and sharper, especially for fast motion, because the whole frame updates at once.



        When we say 720 lines or 1080 lines, we are talking about the number of horizontal rows of pixels that make up the picture.

                Think of your screen like graph paper:

                        - Each little square is a pixel.
                        - The rows across the screen (from left to right) are the lines.

                So:

                        - 720p means the image has 720 rows of pixels stacked from top to bottom.
                        - 1080p means it has 1080 rows of pixels.

                Example:

                        - 720p usually = 1280 × 720 pixels (1280 columns × 720 rows).
                        - 1080p = 1920 × 1080 pixels.

                👉 More lines (rows) = more detail, because the screen has more pixels to show the picture.

-----------
🎬 FFmpeg Processing

        Processing step (happens on raw data, because compressed data is hard to modify directly):

                - Resize video (e.g., 1080p → 720p).
                - Change frame rate (e.g., 60fps → 30fps).
                - Apply filters (watermark, brightness, crop, etc.).
                - Adjust audio (volume, remove noise, sync).

        When we talk about resizing (scaling) a video, you can actually go both ways:

                🔽 Downscaling (common case):

                        - Convert higher resolution → lower resolution.
                        - Example: 4K (3840×2160) → 1080p (1920×1080).
                        - This saves bandwidth and storage. Most streaming services do this to provide multiple qualities (adaptive streaming).

                🔼 Upscaling (possible, but limited):

                        - Convert lower resolution → higher resolution.
                        - Example: 720p (1280×720) → 1080p (1920×1080).
                        - But here, you don’t magically get extra detail — FFmpeg just stretches and interpolates pixels, so it looks bigger but not sharper. Some advanced AI upscalers (like Topaz Video Enhance AI) try to add detail, but normal FFmpeg upscaling can look blurry.



        📌 Where resolution changes

                - Changing resolution (480p → 720p → 1080p) = resizing filter.
                - This belongs to the processing stage (because it’s a transformation of raw frames).
                - But it’s always paired with re-encoding, because raw frames are too huge to store/stream.

        So the flow is:

                - Decode → raw frames.
                - Processing (resize) → raw frames resized to target resolution.
                - Encoding → compress those resized frames into H.264/VP9/etc.

        ✅ That’s why we usually say “resolution conversion happens during encoding,”
        because in practice, FFmpeg does resize + encode in one command.

YUV420p and PCM

        🎨 YUV420p (raw video format)

                - A way to represent video frames.
                - Splits image into:
                        - Y = brightness (luma)
                        - U & V = color (chroma)
                - 420" means: color info is stored at 1/4 resolution of brightness → saves space without hurting quality much.
                - This is how raw video frames are usually handled inside video tools.

                👉 Think of it as: a raw picture of every frame, stored efficiently.

        🎵 PCM (Pulse Code Modulation, raw audio format)

                - A way to represent sound as numbers.
                - Records the amplitude of sound waves many times per second (samples).
                - Example: CD audio = 44,100 samples per second.
                - It’s uncompressed → very big, but simple and accurate.

                👉 Think of it as: a raw recording of the sound wave.

🎬 FFmpeg Encoding

        When FFmpeg does the encoding step, it usually converts the raw video/audio into widely supported codecs so that almost any device/browser can play them.

        Common Codecs After Encoding:

        🎥 Video:

                - H.264 (AVC) → most common, supported everywhere (phones, browsers, TVs).
                - H.265 (HEVC) → newer, smaller file size, but licensing + less browser support.
                - VP9 / AV1 → open-source alternatives (Google’s VP9, newer AV1).

        🔊 Audio:

                - AAC → most common audio codec for MP4/HLS/DASH.
                - MP3 (older, less efficient).
                - Opus (great quality, used in WebRTC, some streaming).

        👉 So, if you upload an .mp4 file to YouTube:

                1) YouTube decodes it to raw frames & samples.
                2) Then re-encodes it into multiple versions like:

                        - 1080p H.264 + AAC
                        - 720p H.264 + AAC
                        - 480p H.264 + AAC
                        - … maybe also VP9/AV1 for better compression.

                3) Packs them into containers (.mp4 for VOD, .ts for HLS chunks).

                That way, your video is playable across all browsers, TVs, and phones.

        ⚡ So to answer you simply:
        The encoding step usually outputs H.264 video + AAC audio, because that pair is universal and safe.





        🎬 Step 1: Upload

                You upload video.mp4 (say, H.264 codec, AAC audio, 1080p resolution).
                The server receives the file and stores it temporarily.

        🎬 Step 2: FFmpeg starts processing

                FFmpeg pipeline will look like this:

                        (a) Decode

                                - FFmpeg reads video.mp4.
                                - It decodes the compressed H.264 video into raw frames (YUV420p format usually).
                                - Audio is decoded into raw PCM samples.

                                👉 Now we have the video as raw images + raw audio samples.

                        (b) Processing (resizing into 4 versions)

                                FFmpeg duplicates the raw video stream into 4 branches:

                                        - 1080p branch → keep same resolution.
                                        - 720p branch → scale down raw frames from 1920×1080 → 1280×720.
                                        - 480p branch → scale down to 854×480.
                                        - 360p branch → scale down to 640×360.

                                ⚡ This happens via FFmpeg’s scale filter (e.g., -vf scale=1280:720).

                        (c) Encoding

                                Each branch is encoded (compressed) again into a codec.

                                        - Video → H.264 (common for playback).
                                        - Audio → AAC (common for playback).

                                Bitrate is set for each version (e.g., 1080p = 5 Mbps, 720p = 3 Mbps, 480p = 1.5 Mbps, 360p = 800 kbps).

                                So now you have 4 compressed streams:

                                        - 1080p_h264_aac.mp4
                                        - 720p_h264_aac.mp4
                                        - 480p_h264_aac.mp4
                                        - 360p_h264_aac.mp4

                        (d) Packaging

                                Now, depending on what you want:

                                        1) If VOD (progressive download): Just keep the 4 MP4 files.

                                        2) If adaptive streaming (HLS/DASH):

                                                - Split each MP4 into chunks (e.g., .ts files of 6s each).
                                                - Generate a playlist (.m3u8 for HLS or .mpd for DASH) that tells the player which resolution versions are available.
                                                - Player can switch between resolutions dynamically.

                                                Example:

                                                        - 1080p_000.ts, 1080p_001.ts, …
                                                        - 720p_000.ts, 720p_001.ts, …
                                                        - master.m3u8 (index file that lists all 4 versions).

                                                📌 Final Flow (stepwise)

                                                        - Upload: video.mp4 (1080p).
                                                        - Decode: compressed H.264 → raw frames (YUV) + raw PCM audio.
                                                        - Process: apply filters → resize into 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p.
                                                        - Encode: compress each with H.264 + AAC, assign different bitrates.
                                                        - Package: save as MP4 (for direct VOD) OR chunk + playlist (for HLS/DASH).



        1) FFmpeg decodes your uploaded MP4 into raw frames (images in YUV420p) and raw audio (PCM).

                - These raw frames are not written to disk (too huge!).
                - They stay in RAM (memory).

        2) Filters (processing stage) run in memory.

                - FFmpeg takes each decoded frame in RAM.
                - Then it applies the scale filter multiple times:

                        - One copy stays 1080p.
                        - Another copy gets resized to 720p.
                        - Another to 480p.
                        - Another to 360p.

                        So at this moment, 4 different versions of the same raw frame exist in memory.

        3) Encoders then compress each branch (H.264 + AAC) immediately while still in RAM.
                - Encoded chunks or MP4 files are written out to disk/network.

        🔄 How it actually works:

                1) FFmpeg reads a small chunk of the video file.
                2) It decodes that part → raw video frame + raw audio samples.
                3) That raw frame goes through the filters (resizing → 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p).
                4) Each resized copy exists only briefly in memory.
                5) Each copy is immediately sent to the encoder, compressed, and written to output (disk or network).
                6) Once a frame is finished, FFmpeg discards it from RAM and moves to the next frame.

🎥 What is Progressive Download and how it works?

                - Imagine you upload one MP4 file (say a 720p video).
                - When a user clicks play, the video starts downloading from the server just like any other file (like downloading a PDF).
                - BUT — modern video players (like HTML5 <video> tag) don’t wait for the whole file to finish downloading.
                - Instead:

                        - As soon as the first part of the file arrives, playback begins.
                        - While the user watches, the rest of the file keeps downloading in the background.

                - This is why it’s called progressive → because playback progresses as download progresses.

        ⚡ Key Characteristics:

                ✅ Simple: Only one MP4 per resolution.
                ✅ Works on most browsers without special setup.
                ❌ Not adaptive: If a user’s internet slows down, the video may buffer (pause).
                ❌ Higher bandwidth waste: If a user only watches the first 2 minutes, the player might still download the whole file.

        🔄 Comparison with Adaptive Streaming (HLS/DASH):

                - In adaptive streaming, the video is cut into small chunks (e.g., 6s .ts files).
                - The player chooses which resolution chunk to download based on your internet speed (720p if fast, 360p if slow).
                - If network conditions change mid-playback, the player can switch resolution seamlessly.

                Example:

                        - Progressive: One full MP4 file → plays start to finish.
                        - Adaptive: Many small chunks → player selects best chunk quality dynamically.

        🧩 How Video is Divided into Chunks (for adaptive streaming)

                Let’s say you have a 1-minute video:

                        - If chunk size = 10 seconds → the encoder splits it into 6 chunks.
                        - Each chunk is a self-contained mini video segment (with its own audio+video+metadata).
                        - Plus, a playlist file (.m3u8 for HLS) is created which lists the order of chunks.
                        - The player just reads this playlist and fetches chunks one by one.

        👉 So, in short:

                - Progressive download = one big MP4, downloaded + played progressively.
                - Adaptive streaming = many small chunks, playlist tells which chunk to play, and resolution can change mid-stream.



        🔹 How Progressive Download Works

                One big MP4 file exists on the server.
                        Example: movie.mp4.

                When you press play in the browser/video player:
                        - The player sends a HTTP request to the server for the file.
                        - The server starts sending the MP4 in small pieces (packets) over the internet.

                The MP4 file is designed with something called an index (moov atom).

                        - This index tells the player where the video and audio data are inside the file.
                        - If the index is at the beginning of the file, the player can start playback immediately as data comes in.

                Streaming while downloading:

                        - The player doesn’t need the whole file to start.
                        - It only needs enough data to decode the first few seconds.
                        - While you’re watching second 1–10, the player is downloading second 11–20 in the background.
                        - This is why playback feels like “streaming,” even though technically it’s just a download.

                🔹 Example

                        - Suppose the video is 100 MB.
                        - You press play → the first 5 MB (say 10 seconds of video) downloads.
                        - The player starts showing that part immediately.
                        - Meanwhile, the rest of the video keeps downloading.
                        - If your internet is fast → the download stays ahead of playback.
                        - If your internet is slow → playback may catch up to the download → buffering happens.

                🔹 Key Idea

                        - You can watch while it’s still downloading because:
                        - The MP4 is structured so that the metadata (index) is available early.
                        - The player only needs a small portion of the file at a time to keep going.
                        - Download + playback happen in parallel.

                💡 Think of it like eating pizza:

                        - The whole pizza (video file) is being baked (downloaded).
                        - As soon as the first slice is ready, you start eating it.
                        - Meanwhile, the rest of the pizza keeps coming out of the oven.
                        - If the oven is too slow, you’ll have to wait before your next slice → that’s buffering.



        🔹 1. What is the moov atom?

                In an MP4 file, data is stored in “atoms” (or boxes).

                        - mdat atom = contains the actual media data (video + audio bytes).
                        - moov atom = contains the movie info (index/table of contents).

                Think of the moov atom like the table of contents of a book:

                It tells you:

                        - where each video frame is inside the file,
                        - the duration,
                        - timing information (timestamps),
                        - codec details (e.g., H.264 video, AAC audio),
                        - how audio and video are synchronized.

                Without the moov atom, the player wouldn’t know where to look in the raw media data.

        🔹 2. How it works when you play a video:

                - The video player first downloads the moov atom (tiny file info, maybe a few KB).
                - From moov, it learns:

                        - “Okay, the video is H.264, the audio is AAC.”
                        - “The first frame starts here, the second frame is here…”
                        - “If the user seeks to 2:30, I can jump directly to this byte in the file.”

                - After that, it starts downloading the mdat (the real video/audio data) little by little.
                - Since moov told the player where frames are, it can start showing frames as soon as enough data comes in — without waiting for the whole file.

        🔹 3. Why must moov be first?

                - If the moov atom is at the start → player gets the instructions immediately, so playback starts quickly.
                - If the moov atom is at the end → the player must download the whole video file before it even knows how to play it. (That’s bad for streaming.)

        🔹 4. How can video play before the full file is downloaded?

                Because the player doesn’t need the entire file at once. It just needs:

                        - The index (moov atom).
                        - The first few frames + audio samples i.e mdat.

                Once it has those, it can start showing the video. Meanwhile, the rest is still downloading.

        🔹 5. But we didn’t divide the video into chunks… so how is it downloaded?

                Here’s the trick:

                        - The server doesn’t send the file as one big piece.
                        - When you download anything over HTTP/TCP, the file is automatically broken down into packets (small pieces of data).
                        - These packets flow from server → internet → player.
                        - The player’s job is to buffer those packets until it has enough to decode a few seconds of video.
                        - So even though you didn’t create .ts chunks (like HLS does), the network itself delivers the file in little packets.
                        - 👉 That’s why playback feels like “chunks,” even though it’s just one file being streamed sequentially.



        In progressive download, you can’t just jump to the last 2 minutes without downloading everything before it (unless the player has already buffered that part).

                Here’s why:

                        - Remember the mdat (the actual video/audio data)?
                        - In progressive download, the server just sends the file sequentially from start to end.
                        - Even if the moov atom tells you “the last 2 minutes start at byte X,” the server isn’t cutting the file for you — it’s still sending everything in order.

                So:

                        - If you skip ahead, the player will either keep downloading all data until that part is reached (wasting bandwidth)…
                        - Or it must request a new file starting from that byte offset, but most simple HTTP servers don’t support that unless byte-range requests are enabled.

                🔑 Main difference with streaming (HLS/DASH):

                        - In adaptive streaming, the video is already split into chunks (like 6-second .ts files).
                        - If you want the last 2 minutes, the player just requests the final 20 chunks directly — no need to download the earlier part.

                👉 So in progressive download, practically you have to download the whole file sequentially.
                👉 In true streaming, you only fetch the parts you need.

🎬 FFmpeg Packaging

        Now comes HLS’s role:
                Packaging: 
                        - Takes the encoded video (e.g., H.264 + AAC inside MP4)
                        - Splits it into segments (e.g., .ts or .m4s)
                        - Creates .m3u8 playlists describing how to play those segments
                        
                Delivery: 
                        - Client requests the master playlist therefore the player (e.g., Safari or VLC) first downloads master.m3u8. → It lists available qualities (1080p, 720p, etc.).
                        - Player picks a quality based on the user’s internet speed, it chooses (say) 720p.m3u8.
                        - Player requests chunks → It downloads them one by one over HTTP (just normal web requests).
                        - Adaptive switching → If the internet slows down, the player switches to a lower-quality .m3u8 (e.g., 480p) and continues downloading those chunks seamlessly.

        1. Starting Point: Encoded MP4s

                After encoding, you have multiple full-length MP4 files for each resolution:

                        1080p.mp4
                        720p.mp4
                        480p.mp4
                        360p.mp4


                Each of these files is just a regular video. If you give them directly to a player (progressive download), the user will need to download the whole file, and switching to a lower quality on slow internet is not possible.

        2. Goal: Adaptive Streaming

                We want the player to:

                - Play videos without long buffering.
                - Switch automatically to lower/higher quality based on network speed.

                To do this, we split videos into small “chunks” (usually 2–10 seconds each).

        3. How Chunking Works

                1) Define chunk duration: 
                        For example: 6 seconds per chunk.

                2) Split the video:
                        FFmpeg can take a large MP4 and break it into multiple small files:

                        ffmpeg -i 1080p.mp4 \
                        -c copy \
                        -map 0 \
                        -f segment \
                        -segment_time 6 \
                        -segment_format mpegts 1080p_%03d.ts


                        Explanation of the command:

                                Option	                        Meaning

                                -i 1080p.mp4	                Input video file
                                -c copy	                        Copy audio/video without re-encoding (fast)
                                -map 0	                        Include all streams (video, audio, subtitles)
                                -f segment	                Use FFmpeg’s segmenting feature
                                -segment_time 6	                Each segment = 6 seconds
                                -segment_format mpegts	        Use .ts format (good for HLS)
                                1080p_%03d.ts	                Output files: 1080p_000.ts, 1080p_001.ts, …

                3) Result:
                        Instead of one large video, you now have many small .ts files:

                        1080p_000.ts  # 0–6 sec
                        1080p_001.ts  # 6–12 sec
                        1080p_002.ts  # 12–18 sec
                        ...

        4. Playlists: Connecting Chunks

                - Chunks themselves are useless unless the player knows in which order to play them.
                - This is where .m3u8 playlist comes in (HLS format):

                1) Master playlist: Lists all qualities (resolutions):

                        #EXTM3U
                        #EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=5000000,RESOLUTION=1920x1080
                        1080p.m3u8
                        #EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=3000000,RESOLUTION=1280x720
                        720p.m3u8
                        #EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=1500000,RESOLUTION=854x480
                        480p.m3u8
                        #EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=800000,RESOLUTION=640x360
                        360p.m3u8


                2) Resolution playlist (example: 1080p.m3u8) lists the actual chunks:

                        #EXTM3U
                        #EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:6
                        #EXTINF:6.0,
                        1080p_000.ts
                        #EXTINF:6.0,
                        1080p_001.ts
                        #EXTINF:6.0,
                        1080p_002.ts


                        Explanation:

                                - #EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:6 → Each chunk ~6 seconds
                                - #EXTINF:6.0 → Duration of this segment
                                - Then the chunk file name → player downloads in order

        5. Adaptive Bitrate Streaming

                - The player starts downloading the first chunk from the highest available quality.
                - If the network slows, the player automatically switches to a lower-quality playlist and starts fetching chunks from there (e.g., 720p_004.ts instead of 1080p_004.ts).
                - This switch is seamless because each chunk is independent and small.

        6. How the Chunks Are Stored and Accessed

        1) Storage: On your server, you store:

                /videos/
                        1080p_000.ts
                        1080p_001.ts
                        1080p_002.ts
                        1080p.m3u8
                        720p_000.ts
                        720p.m3u8
                        480p_000.ts
                        480p.m3u8
                        360p_000.ts
                        360p.m3u8
                        master.m3u8


        2) Access: The player requests:

                1) master.m3u8 → shows all qualities
                2) 1080p.m3u8 → fetches the first chunk
                3) Downloads chunks sequentially as the video plays
                4) Switches resolution automatically if network conditions change

        ✅ Summary

                - Large MP4 → split into small .ts chunks using FFmpeg
                - Each resolution has its own set of chunks
                - A playlist file tells the player which chunks to play in which order
                - The player can switch between qualities seamlessly
                - Adaptive streaming ensures smooth playback on varying networks





        7. During Chunking (HLS Packaging)

                When you package for HLS (HTTP Live Streaming):

                        - Video codec: usually still H.264
                        - Audio codec: usually still AAC
                        - Container for each chunk: MPEG-TS (.ts)

                So each 1080p_000.ts file is not a re-encoded video. It’s just the same H.264 + AAC streams wrapped inside an MPEG-TS container.

        8. ❓ Why .ts (MPEG-TS) instead of .mp4?

                - MPEG-TS (Transport Stream) is designed for broadcasting → robust against packet loss, easy to cut/split at keyframes.
                - It allows the player to join mid-stream (important for live streaming).
                - Historically, HLS used .ts because Apple TVs, iPhones, etc. supported it directly.

        9. Alternatives

                Today, you’re not limited to .ts:
                        HLS with fMP4 (fragmented MP4, .m4s chunks)
                                - More efficient, smaller overhead than .ts
                                - Required for new codecs like HEVC (H.265), AV1
                                - Used with CMAF (Common Media Application Format), so the same chunks can be used for HLS and MPEG-DASH.

        10. How FFmpeg Chooses

                - By default, when you run:

                        ffmpeg -i 1080p.mp4 \
                                -c:v h264 -c:a aac \
                                -f hls -hls_time 6 \
                                1080p.m3u8


                        FFmpeg will:

                                - Encode/keep video as H.264, audio as AAC
                                - Segment into .ts chunks
                                - Generate 1080p.m3u8 playlist pointing to those .ts files

                - If you want fMP4 chunks instead of .ts, you add:

                        ffmpeg -i 1080p.mp4 \
                                -c:v h264 -c:a aac \
                                -f hls -hls_time 6 \
                                -hls_segment_type fmp4 \
                                1080p.m3u8


                        This generates chunks like:

                                1080p_000.m4s
                                1080p_001.m4s
                                ...





        🔹 The .ts Chunks (MPEG-TS Containers)

                When FFmpeg segments your video, each output file:

                        1080p_000.ts
                        1080p_001.ts
                        1080p_002.ts

                - is itself a complete MPEG-TS container file.
                - That means each .ts file already is a container — it contains H.264 video packets + AAC audio packets inside it.
                - There is no bigger container wrapping these .ts chunks.

        🔹 How They Are Managed

                Instead of putting all the .ts files inside one "super-container", HLS uses:

                        - A plain text playlist file (.m3u8) as the "index".
                        - This file is not a container — it’s just instructions for the player about which .ts chunks exist, in what order, and for which resolution.

                So the hierarchy looks like this:

                📂 Server Folder
                ├── master.m3u8         # Master playlist (lists all qualities)
                ├── 1080p.m3u8          # Playlist for 1080p chunks
                ├── 1080p_000.ts        # Chunk 1 (MPEG-TS container)
                ├── 1080p_001.ts        # Chunk 2 (MPEG-TS container)
                ├── 720p.m3u8
                ├── 720p_000.ts
                ├── 720p_001.ts
                ...

        🔹 Important Distinction

                - Each .ts file  → standalone MPEG-TS container (not wrapped by anything else).
                - The .m3u8 file → playlist index (just text), not a container.
                - There is no “super container” that holds all .ts files. Instead, the playlist + HTTP server together give the illusion of a continuous video.





        🔹 Two Types of Playlists in HLS

                1. Master Playlist (master.m3u8)

                        - This is the entry point for the video player.
                        - It doesn’t list chunks directly.
                        - Instead, it lists the different quality levels / renditions (1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p…).
                        - Example:

                                #EXTM3U
                                #EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=5000000,RESOLUTION=1920x1080
                                1080p.m3u8
                                #EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=3000000,RESOLUTION=1280x720
                                720p.m3u8
                                #EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=1500000,RESOLUTION=854x480
                                480p.m3u8
                                #EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=800000,RESOLUTION=640x360
                                360p.m3u8


                        👉 This says to the player: “Here are 4 different versions of the same video. Pick the one that matches your network/bandwidth.”

                2. Media Playlist (e.g., 1080p.m3u8)

                        - This is specific to one quality level.
                        - It lists the actual chunks (.ts files or .m4s files) that make up that stream.
                        - Example (1080p.m3u8):

                                #EXTM3U
                                #EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:6
                                #EXTINF:6.0,
                                1080p_000.ts
                                #EXTINF:6.0,
                                1080p_001.ts
                                #EXTINF:6.0,
                                1080p_002.ts
                                ...

                        👉 This says: “Play these files in this order: 000, 001, 002… Each lasts 6 seconds.”

                🔹 How They Work Together

                        1) Player requests master.m3u8 first.

                                - That’s the very first file you give to a video player (like Safari, VLC, JWPlayer, etc.).
                                - The player reads it and learns: “There are multiple bitrates available.”

                        2) Player chooses a quality (e.g., 1080p) based on:

                                - Initial bandwidth test
                                - Screen size/resolution

                                Then it downloads 1080p.m3u8.

                        3) Player follows 1080p.m3u8.

                                - It requests the first chunk (1080p_000.ts), then 1080p_001.ts, and so on.

                        4) Adaptive Switching.

                                - If the network slows down, the player can go back to the master playlist, pick another quality (say 720p.m3u8), and continue by requesting 720p_005.ts instead of 1080p_005.ts.

                        🔹 Analogy

                        Master Playlist = Table of Contents (which books are available).
                        Media Playlist = Chapter List of one book (the actual pages to read).
                        Chunks = Pages.

                🔍 Line by Line

                        - #EXTM3U → Marks this file as an HLS playlist (required header).
                        - #EXT-X-STREAM-INF → Describes one video stream (rendition).
                                - BANDWIDTH=5000000 → This stream is about 5 Mbps.
                                - RESOLUTION=1920x1080 → Full HD.
                                - Next line (1080p.m3u8) → The playlist file for this version.

                        Same logic repeats for 720p, 480p, and 360p.

                        👉 So this file is basically a menu of options. The video player reads it and says:
                        "Okay, I have 4 versions available. Let’s try 1080p first if the internet is fast, otherwise I’ll fall back to lower ones."

        🟢 2. 1080p.m3u8

                #EXTM3U
                #EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:6
                #EXTINF:6.0,
                1080p_000.ts
                #EXTINF:6.0,
                1080p_001.ts
                #EXTINF:6.0,
                1080p_002.ts
                ...

                🔍 Line by Line

                        - #EXTM3U → Again, this marks it as a valid HLS playlist.
                        - #EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:6 → The maximum chunk duration is 6 seconds. (Player expects chunks around 6s each).
                        - #EXTINF:6.0, → This specific chunk lasts 6.0 seconds.
                        - 1080p_000.ts → The actual video chunk file (MPEG-TS segment).
                        - Then it repeats for chunk 1, chunk 2, etc.

                        👉 This file is the roadmap of all chunks for one quality. The player reads it and fetches them one by one.

        🟢 How They Work Together

                1) Player loads master.m3u8.
                        → Learns all available resolutions.

                2) Player picks one (say 1080p).
                        → Downloads 1080p.m3u8.

                3) Player reads 1080p.m3u8.
                        → Downloads 1080p_000.ts, plays it.
                        → Then 1080p_001.ts, plays it…

                4) If the internet slows 
                        → player switches back to master.m3u8, then moves to 720p.m3u8 and starts fetching 720p_005.ts (same time position, lower quality).

Video Streaming Protocols
        🌐 1. HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)

                - Made by Apple.
                - Works by cutting video into small chunks (.ts files) and using a playlist (.m3u8) to tell the player what to play.
                - Delivered over normal HTTP → works with CDNs, browsers, and mobile.
                - Latency: ~5–10 seconds.
                - Best for: video-on-demand, scalable live streams (like YouTube, Disney+).

                👉 Example:
                When you watch a YouTube video or a live stream, chances are it’s running on HLS behind the scenes.

        🌐 2. DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP)

        Similar to HLS, but made by an international standard (MPEG), not just Apple.
        Uses .mpd files (instead of .m3u8) to describe the chunks.

                - Supports adaptive bitrate (like HLS).
                - More flexible and codec-agnostic (works with H.264, H.265, VP9, AV1).
                - Latency: usually ~5–10 seconds (same as HLS).
                - Best for: platforms that want to support many devices, codecs, or DRM (Netflix uses DASH a lot).

        📡 3. RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol)

                - An older protocol created by Macromedia (Flash era).
                - Still used today as the ingest protocol:
                - OBS (screen recording tool) → RTMP → Server (YouTube, Twitch, Facebook Live).
                - Not good for playback anymore (since Flash is dead).
                - But excellent for sending streams from broadcasters to servers because it’s simple and stable.
                - Latency: very low (<2 seconds when direct), but usually re-transcoded into HLS/DASH for viewers.
                - Best for: getting a live stream into the system.

                🔹 What is an ingest protocol?

                        - Ingest = “how the video first enters the streaming system.”
                        - When you stream live, your computer (with OBS, or browser) captures video and sends it to a server.
                        - The protocol used to send that video is called the ingest protocol.

                        👉 Example:
                        You → OBS → send video → YouTube server
                        That “sending step” uses an ingest protocol.

                🔹 Why RTMP is still used for ingest

                        - RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol) is very good at sending live video quickly and reliably.
                        - Even though it was made in the Flash era, it’s still the standard way for broadcasters (like OBS, cameras, encoders) to send streams into platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and Facebook.

                👉 Why not use HLS/DASH directly?

                        - HLS/DASH are great for playback (viewers) but have 5–10 sec latency (too slow for ingest).
                        - RTMP is low-latency (<2 sec) and stable → perfect for getting video into the system.

                🔹 The Usual Flow

                        - Your PC runs OBS (or another encoder).
                        - OBS uses RTMP to send your video to YouTube’s server.
                        - YouTube receives RTMP → converts it into HLS/DASH → sends it to viewers.

                        👉 So, RTMP is used on the “input” side, not the “output” side anymore.


                RTMP’s Role

                        - RTMP is mainly used to send (ingest) the live video from the user (broadcaster) → server (YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, etc.).
                        - After the server receives it, it usually converts (transcodes) the video into formats that viewers’ devices can play (like HLS/DASH/WebRTC).

                🔹 Why Not Use RTMP for Viewers?

                        - Back in the Flash Player era, viewers also watched via RTMP.
                        - But Flash is dead (not supported in browsers anymore).
                        - So today:
                                - RTMP = input only (user → server).
                                - HLS/DASH/WebRTC = output to viewers.

                🔹 Typical Live Streaming Flow:

                        Streamer (OBS / Camera / Browser)
                        ↓   (RTMP)
                        Ingest Server (YouTube, Twitch, etc.)
                        ↓   (transcoding to HLS/DASH/WebRTC)
                        Viewers (browser / phone / TV)


                ✅ So, in simple words:
                        - RTMP is the delivery truck 🚚 that carries your live video from your PC to YouTube’s warehouse (server).
                        - Then YouTube repackages it into viewer-friendly formats (HLS, DASH) and delivers it to the audience.

        ✅ Quick Analogy

        RTMP → the delivery truck: it carries your live video from your PC to YouTube’s servers.
        HLS/DASH → the supermarket shelves: videos are chopped, packaged, and put out for millions of viewers to pick up chunk by chunk.

📦 In VOD, how video goes to the server
        1️⃣ Upload instead of stream

                - In VOD, the video is pre-recorded (e.g., mygame.mp4).
                - You don’t stream it in real-time.
                - Instead, you upload the whole file to the server (like uploading a photo).

                👉 Example:
                When you upload a video to YouTube, it first shows “uploading…” — that’s the VOD upload step.

        2️⃣ Methods to send video

                -> HTTP Upload (most common)

                        - Your browser/app sends the file over HTTP/HTTPS.
                        - Usually via a POST request with multipart/form-data.
                        - Server receives it and saves it (disk, object storage like S3).

                -> Resumable Upload (for large files)

                        - Breaks video into chunks.
                        - Uploads chunks one by one.
                        - If upload fails midway, it can resume from last chunk.
                        - Example: YouTube and Google Drive use this.

                -> Direct-to-Object Storage

                        - Instead of hitting your backend first, the client uploads video directly to S3/GCS/Azure Blob using a signed URL.
                        - Faster and avoids overloading your main server.

        3️⃣ After Upload

                -> The raw video file now sits on your server (or storage bucket).
                -> Then, your backend triggers FFmpeg (or a transcoding service) to:
                        - Convert it into H.264 + AAC (standard codecs).
                        - Slice it into chunks (.ts files).
                        - Generate playlists (.m3u8 for HLS).
                -> After this, it’s ready for streaming to viewers.

        ✅ Key Difference from Live

                - Live streaming (RTMP/WebRTC) → sends data continuously in real time.
                - VOD (upload) → sends the whole file first, then processes and delivers later.

                👉 That’s why in VOD, you can pause, rewind, or skip — because the full video is available after upload + processing.

        ⚡ Example in Your VOD App:

                User → (HTTP upload POST /upload) → Server/Storage
                → Server triggers FFmpeg → HLS/DASH files created
                → Stored on CDN/Storage → Viewer plays via .m3u8
