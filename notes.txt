        🎥 Types of Streaming

                1️⃣ On-Demand Streaming (VOD – Video on Demand)

                        -> Content is pre-recorded.
                        -> Stored on servers and delivered in chunks (HLS, DASH).
                        -> User can pause, rewind, skip ahead.
                        👉 Examples: YouTube videos, Netflix, Disney+, Spotify songs.

                2️⃣ Live Streaming

                        -> Content is captured and transmitted in real time.
                        -> Viewers watch as it happens, with small delay (latency).
                        -> Uses RTMP → HLS/DASH/WebRTC to reach viewers.
                        👉 Examples: Twitch, YouTube Live, football match broadcast, live webinars.

                3️⃣ Audio Streaming

                        -> Focused only on audio data (music, podcasts, radio).
                        -> Works similarly to video streaming but lighter.
                        👉 Examples: Spotify, Apple Music, online radio.

                4️⃣ Game/Screen Streaming

                        -> Captures your screen/gameplay and streams it live to others.
                        -> Requires low latency so viewers don’t see big delays.
                        👉 Examples: Twitch gaming streams, Discord screen share, Google Stadia (cloud gaming).

                5️⃣ Real-Time Communication (RTC)

                        -> Interactive streaming where people send/receive audio + video both ways.
                        -> Requires ultra-low latency (<1s).
                        -> Usually built on WebRTC.
                        👉 Examples: Zoom, Google Meet, video calls, online classes.

                6️⃣ Progressive Download (not true streaming, but often confused)

                        -> Video/audio file is downloaded from start → end.
                        -> Can start playing before fully downloaded.
                        -> No adaptive bitrate, less efficient than HLS/DASH.
                        👉 Example: Watching an MP4 directly from a web link.

🎬 Full Flow of VOD System


        1️⃣ Upload Stage (Content Creation)

        User/Streamer uploads a video file (.mp4, .mov, etc.) to your system.
        This is just the raw file — not yet optimized for streaming.
        👉 Example: You upload mygame.mp4.

        2️⃣ Processing Stage (Transcoding & Packaging)

        FFmpeg (or another encoder) takes the raw file and:
                1) Transcodes it into standard codecs:
                        -> Video → H.264 (for wide compatibility)
                        -> Audio → AAC

                2) Creates multiple bitrates/resolutions:

                        -> 1080p (high quality)
                        -> 720p (medium)
                        -> 480p (low, for slow internet)

                3) splits video into chunks (small .ts files, e.g., 4–10 seconds each).

                4) Generates playlist(s) (.m3u8 for HLS or .mpd for DASH).

        👉 Output looks like this:

        master.m3u8     ← points to all qualities
        1080p.m3u8      ← lists 1080p chunks
        720p.m3u8
        480p.m3u8
        segment0.ts
        segment1.ts
        segment2.ts
        ...

        3️⃣ Storage & Distribution

                - All these files (chunks + playlists) are saved on:
                        -> Your server, or
                        -> A CDN (Content Delivery Network) like AWS CloudFront, Cloudflare, Akamai.
                - Since it’s just HTTP files, it can be delivered at scale easily.

        4️⃣ Playback (Viewer Side)

        - The user opens your app/website.
        - The video player (like hls.js in a React/Next.js frontend) loads the master.m3u8.
        - The player:
                -> Reads which qualities (1080p, 720p, etc.) are available.
                -> Picks one based on internet speed.
                -> Starts downloading small .ts chunks in order.
                -> If bandwidth drops, it auto-switches to lower quality (adaptive bitrate).

        👉 To the viewer, it looks like a smooth YouTube-style experience.

        5️⃣ User Experience

                -> Can pause, rewind, seek (because the whole file exists).
                -> Smooth playback because only small chunks are streamed at a time.
                -> Adaptive streaming ensures minimal buffering.

        ✅ Summary Flow (Step by Step)

        [Uploader]
        ↓ (raw video)
        [Server: FFmpeg]
        - Transcode → H.264 + AAC
        - Multi-quality → 1080p/720p/480p
        - Chunking → segment0.ts, segment1.ts…
        - Playlist → .m3u8 (HLS)
        ↓
        [Storage/CDN]
        - Stores chunks + playlists
        ↓
        [Viewer Player (hls.js)]
        - Loads master.m3u8
        - Fetches .ts chunks over HTTP
        - Plays video, adapts quality


        👉 In one sentence:
        VOD = Upload video → Server processes into streaming format → Store as chunks + playlist → Player downloads & plays smoothly.

Video Formats
        🎬 What is an MP4 file?

        MP4 = “MPEG-4 Part 14”
        It’s a container format → like a box that holds different types of media.
        Inside an MP4, you can have:

                -> Video (usually H.264, H.265, VP9…)
                -> Audio (usually AAC, MP3…)
                -> Subtitles (captions)
                -> Metadata (title, duration, thumbnail, etc.)

        👉 Think of MP4 as a folder in one file that packs video + audio + extras together neatly.

        🎞 What is a MOV file?

                -> MOV = Apple QuickTime Movie format.
                -> Also a container format, just like MP4.
                -> Developed by Apple → works best in Mac/iOS/QuickTime ecosystem.
                -> Stores the same kinds of things: video, audio, subtitles, metadata.

        🔑 Difference Between MP4 and MOV

                Feature 	        MP4	                                        MOV

                Origin  	        Standard (MPEG group)	                        Apple (QuickTime)
                Compatibility           Works everywhere (web, PC, mobile, TV)	        Best on Apple devices/software
                File size	        Usually smaller (more compressed)	        Larger (less compressed, higher quality)
                Usage   	        Streaming, sharing, web videos	                Professional video editing (Final Cut, iMovie)

        👉 Example:

        If you upload to YouTube/Netflix → use MP4 (universal).
        If you’re editing in Final Cut Pro on Mac → MOV is common.

Bitrate And Bandwidth
        🎚 What is Bitrate?

                -> Bitrate = the amount of data per second needed to play a video or audio.
                -> Measured in kbps (kilobits per second) or Mbps (megabits per second).

                👉 Example: A video encoded at 5 Mbps means every second of video requires 5 megabits of data.

        Why it matters:

                Higher bitrate → better quality (more detail, less compression).
                Lower bitrate → smaller size, loads faster, but may look blurry or pixelated.

        📡 What is Bandwidth?

                -> Bandwidth = the maximum amount of data your internet connection can transfer per second.
                -> Also measured in Mbps.
                -> Think of it like the width of a water pipe:
                        - Bigger pipe (more bandwidth) → more water (data) flows at once.
                        - Smaller pipe → less water flows, might choke if too much is sent.

        🔄 How Bitrate Consumes Bandwidth

                To watch a video, your internet must handle at least the bitrate of the stream.

                👉 Example:
                        - If a video is encoded at 5 Mbps and your internet bandwidth is 10 Mbps, playback is smooth.
                        - If your internet bandwidth is only 2 Mbps, you’ll see buffering (can’t keep up).

                So:
                        - Bitrate is demand (how much data the video needs).
                        - Bandwidth is supply (how much your network can deliver).

        ⚡ Real-world Example (YouTube/Netflix)

                - 1080p HD → ~5 Mbps bitrate
                - 4K Ultra HD → ~15–25 Mbps bitrate
                - Audio only → ~128 kbps bitrate

                - If your Wi-Fi bandwidth is 20 Mbps: You can easily watch 4K video.
                - If your Wi-Fi bandwidth is 3 Mbps: You’ll have to drop to 480p or 360p to avoid buffering.

        ✅ In short:

        Bitrate = video’s hunger for data per second.
        Bandwidth = how much food (data) your internet pipe can deliver per second.
        The video will only play smoothly if bandwidth ≥ bitrate.
-----------





-----------
📦 What is Object Storage?

        -> Object storage is a way of storing data (like videos, images, documents) in the cloud as objects, not as files in folders or rows in a database.

        Each object has:

                - Data (the actual video, image, etc.)
                - Metadata (info about the file — size, type, created date, etc.)
                - Unique ID (key) to find it

                👉 Example: Instead of saying “video.mp4 is in folder X”, you say “give me object with ID 12345”.

        🔹 How It Works

                - You upload your file → object storage saves it as an object.
                - You don’t care where it’s physically stored — the cloud provider handles it.
                - You access it via a URL or API.

        ✅ Why It’s Useful

                - Scalable: Can store billions of objects (good for YouTube-like apps).
                - Cheap: You only pay for the space used.
                - Durable: Data is stored in multiple locations, so it rarely gets lost.
                - Easy access: Files can be fetched over HTTP.

        🌍 Examples of Object Storage

                - Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
                - Google Cloud Storage
                - Azure Blob Storage
                - MinIO (open-source, S3-compatible)

        🆚 File System vs Database vs Object Storage

                - File system → good for local small-scale use (folders, files).
                - Database → good for structured data (users, transactions).
                - Object storage → good for unstructured, huge data (videos, images, backups).

        🎯 In Your VOD System

                - When users upload videos → store the original file in object storage (like S3).
                - After FFmpeg processes them into chunks + playlists → also save them in object storage.
                - Then connect a CDN (CloudFront, Cloudflare) to deliver them worldwide.

        👉 In one line:
        Object storage = cloud “bucket” where you drop your files (as objects) and fetch them later via URL.

🎥 Video Codecs

        -> A codec = COmpressor + DECompressor → it compresses video so it’s smaller to store/send, then decompresses it for playback.

        🎬 Why do we use Codecs?

                - Raw video and audio are huge. A single minute of uncompressed 1080p video can be several GBs.
                👉 That’s impossible to store, upload, or stream efficiently.

                - So, codecs compress the data while keeping quality good enough.

        In your system (VOD or Live):

                - Streamer (or uploader): The video is encoded (compressed) before sending — OBS, WebRTC, or phone camera usually does this.
                - Server (processing with FFmpeg): If needed, re-encode into different bitrates/qualities (1080p, 720p, 480p).
                - Viewer (player/browser): The codec decompresses the stream so it can play smoothly.

                👉 So codecs are used at all three stages: encode → transmit/store → decode.

        🎥 Where Video is Converted into H.264 (or other codecs)

                1️⃣ At the Source (Client Side)

                        - Most of the time, video is already compressed before leaving your device.
                        - Your webcam, screen capture, or OBS software will encode the raw video into H.264 (video) + AAC (audio) before sending.
                        - Reason: Raw video is HUGE (gigabytes per minute). You can’t send that over the internet.

                👉 Example:

                        - OBS encodes your gameplay in H.264 + AAC and then pushes it to the server using RTMP.
                        - WebRTC in the browser uses built-in codecs (VP8/VP9 or H.264) before sending.


                2️⃣ On the Server (Transcoding Stage)

                        Even if the client already sends H.264, the server often re-encodes:

                                - To generate multiple resolutions/bitrates (1080p, 720p, 480p).
                                - To ensure compatibility across devices (phones, TVs, browsers).
                                - To apply compression settings (reduce bandwidth).

                        👉 This step is usually handled by FFmpeg or a media server (e.g., Wowza, Ant Media, Janus, LiveKit).

                But in case of VOD:
                        Client Side: 
                                - When you upload to YouTube, your browser/app just sends the video file as it is over HTTP/HTTPS to YouTube’s servers.
                                - There is no special compression done before upload (other than whatever codec/format your file already has — e.g., your screen recorder may have already encoded it as MP4/H.264). So if your video file is 1 GB on disk, that 1 GB is uploaded.


                        Once the file is uploaded, YouTube’s backend takes over:

                                - Decode → Read your uploaded file (whatever codec/container it uses: MP4, MOV, etc.).
                                - Re-encode (transcode) into standard formats:
                                        - Video → H.264/VP9/AV1 (multiple qualities: 1080p, 720p, 480p, etc.)
                                        - Audio → AAC/Opus
                                - Package into streaming formats (HLS/DASH).
                                - Store the processed chunks/playlists on their servers/CDNs.
                                - Make it available to viewers with adaptive bitrate streaming.


        Different Codecs (video compression standard):

                1. H.264 (AVC – Advanced Video Coding)

                        - The most common video codec today.
                        - Used by YouTube, Netflix, Zoom, and almost every device.
                        - Balance: Good quality + reasonable file size.
                        - Supported everywhere (browsers, phones, TVs).

                        👉 Think of it as the default video format for the internet.

                2. H.265 (HEVC – High Efficiency Video Coding)

                        - Successor to H.264.
                        - Same quality at ~50% smaller size.
                        - Great for 4K/8K videos (saves bandwidth).
                        - But: More CPU/GPU power needed and not all devices support it (licensing issues).

                        👉 Used in 4K streaming, Blu-ray, and some Apple devices.

                3. VP9

                        - Made by Google as an open-source alternative to H.265.
                        - Also gives smaller file sizes than H.264.
                        - Widely used in YouTube 4K/HD streaming.
                        - Supported in Chrome, Firefox, Android, but not all hardware.

                        👉 Google’s “free” competitor to H.265.
                
                4. AV1
                        - AV1 (newest, by Alliance for Open Media: Google, Netflix, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.) → free and even more efficient than H.265.
                        - Downside: needs more CPU/GPU power to encode.

                🎵 Audio Codec

                        - Audio codecs compress sound like video codecs compress video.

                4. AAC (Advanced Audio Coding)

                        - Standard audio codec for streaming.
                        - Successor to MP3 (better quality at same bitrate).
                        - Used in YouTube, Spotify, iTunes, and all video streaming.
                        - Works well with H.264/H.265/VP9.

                        👉 Think of it as the MP3 of video platforms.

                ✅ Simple Analogy

                        - H.264 / H.265 / VP9 = different ways of packing your video clothes into a suitcase → smaller suitcase = cheaper to ship.
                        - AAC = the way you pack your audio clothes into a smaller bag.

                Together, they make videos streamable without eating too much bandwidth.

                ⚡ Example:

                        - A 10-minute uncompressed 1080p video = hundreds of GBs ❌
                        - Same video with H.264 + AAC = maybe 100 MB ✅

Video Streaming Protocols
        🌐 1. HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)

                - Made by Apple.
                - Works by cutting video into small chunks (.ts files) and using a playlist (.m3u8) to tell the player what to play.
                - Delivered over normal HTTP → works with CDNs, browsers, and mobile.
                - Latency: ~5–10 seconds.
                - Best for: video-on-demand, scalable live streams (like YouTube, Disney+).

                👉 Example:
                When you watch a YouTube video or a live stream, chances are it’s running on HLS behind the scenes.

        🌐 2. DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP)

        Similar to HLS, but made by an international standard (MPEG), not just Apple.
        Uses .mpd files (instead of .m3u8) to describe the chunks.

                - Supports adaptive bitrate (like HLS).
                - More flexible and codec-agnostic (works with H.264, H.265, VP9, AV1).
                - Latency: usually ~5–10 seconds (same as HLS).
                - Best for: platforms that want to support many devices, codecs, or DRM (Netflix uses DASH a lot).

        📡 3. RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol)

                - An older protocol created by Macromedia (Flash era).
                - Still used today as the ingest protocol:
                - OBS (screen recording tool) → RTMP → Server (YouTube, Twitch, Facebook Live).
                - Not good for playback anymore (since Flash is dead).
                - But excellent for sending streams from broadcasters to servers because it’s simple and stable.
                - Latency: very low (<2 seconds when direct), but usually re-transcoded into HLS/DASH for viewers.
                - Best for: getting a live stream into the system.

                🔹 What is an ingest protocol?

                        - Ingest = “how the video first enters the streaming system.”
                        - When you stream live, your computer (with OBS, or browser) captures video and sends it to a server.
                        - The protocol used to send that video is called the ingest protocol.

                        👉 Example:
                        You → OBS → send video → YouTube server
                        That “sending step” uses an ingest protocol.

                🔹 Why RTMP is still used for ingest

                        - RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol) is very good at sending live video quickly and reliably.
                        - Even though it was made in the Flash era, it’s still the standard way for broadcasters (like OBS, cameras, encoders) to send streams into platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and Facebook.

                👉 Why not use HLS/DASH directly?

                        - HLS/DASH are great for playback (viewers) but have 5–10 sec latency (too slow for ingest).
                        - RTMP is low-latency (<2 sec) and stable → perfect for getting video into the system.

                🔹 The Usual Flow

                        - Your PC runs OBS (or another encoder).
                        - OBS uses RTMP to send your video to YouTube’s server.
                        - YouTube receives RTMP → converts it into HLS/DASH → sends it to viewers.

                        👉 So, RTMP is used on the “input” side, not the “output” side anymore.


                RTMP’s Role

                        - RTMP is mainly used to send (ingest) the live video from the user (broadcaster) → server (YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, etc.).
                        - After the server receives it, it usually converts (transcodes) the video into formats that viewers’ devices can play (like HLS/DASH/WebRTC).

                🔹 Why Not Use RTMP for Viewers?

                        - Back in the Flash Player era, viewers also watched via RTMP.
                        - But Flash is dead (not supported in browsers anymore).
                        - So today:
                                - RTMP = input only (user → server).
                                - HLS/DASH/WebRTC = output to viewers.

                🔹 Typical Live Streaming Flow:

                        Streamer (OBS / Camera / Browser)
                        ↓   (RTMP)
                        Ingest Server (YouTube, Twitch, etc.)
                        ↓   (transcoding to HLS/DASH/WebRTC)
                        Viewers (browser / phone / TV)


                ✅ So, in simple words:
                        - RTMP is the delivery truck 🚚 that carries your live video from your PC to YouTube’s warehouse (server).
                        - Then YouTube repackages it into viewer-friendly formats (HLS, DASH) and delivers it to the audience.

        ✅ Quick Analogy

        RTMP → the delivery truck: it carries your live video from your PC to YouTube’s servers.
        HLS/DASH → the supermarket shelves: videos are chopped, packaged, and put out for millions of viewers to pick up chunk by chunk.

📦 In VOD, how video goes to the server
        1️⃣ Upload instead of stream

                - In VOD, the video is pre-recorded (e.g., mygame.mp4).
                - You don’t stream it in real-time.
                - Instead, you upload the whole file to the server (like uploading a photo).

                👉 Example:
                When you upload a video to YouTube, it first shows “uploading…” — that’s the VOD upload step.

        2️⃣ Methods to send video

                -> HTTP Upload (most common)

                        - Your browser/app sends the file over HTTP/HTTPS.
                        - Usually via a POST request with multipart/form-data.
                        - Server receives it and saves it (disk, object storage like S3).

                -> Resumable Upload (for large files)

                        - Breaks video into chunks.
                        - Uploads chunks one by one.
                        - If upload fails midway, it can resume from last chunk.
                        - Example: YouTube and Google Drive use this.

                -> Direct-to-Object Storage

                        - Instead of hitting your backend first, the client uploads video directly to S3/GCS/Azure Blob using a signed URL.
                        - Faster and avoids overloading your main server.

        3️⃣ After Upload

                -> The raw video file now sits on your server (or storage bucket).
                -> Then, your backend triggers FFmpeg (or a transcoding service) to:
                        - Convert it into H.264 + AAC (standard codecs).
                        - Slice it into chunks (.ts files).
                        - Generate playlists (.m3u8 for HLS).
                -> After this, it’s ready for streaming to viewers.

        ✅ Key Difference from Live

                - Live streaming (RTMP/WebRTC) → sends data continuously in real time.
                - VOD (upload) → sends the whole file first, then processes and delivers later.

                👉 That’s why in VOD, you can pause, rewind, or skip — because the full video is available after upload + processing.

        ⚡ Example in Your VOD App:

                User → (HTTP upload POST /upload) → Server/Storage
                → Server triggers FFmpeg → HLS/DASH files created
                → Stored on CDN/Storage → Viewer plays via .m3u8
